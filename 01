What is continuous integration
code commit happen continuously
github server
this code would be build, tested and evaluated
artifact at this stage
stored in a software repository
archive of files generated from teh build process
in a specific format
war / jar in java
dll exe msi windows
tar zip in linux
ship to servers from repos for further testing
software testers can complete software testing to production servers
code will be fetched by the server
this code is built, tested and lots of errors, bug, conflicts
developers have to fix all this defects in severe places
for every commit, the code should be build and tested to avoid bugs
it is not humanly possible to do a release several times a day
automate it
fail notification, fix the code and commit again
build new changes and store in a software repository
most written code
code -> fetch -> build -> test -> notify -> feedback
detect defects at very early stage 

Continuous integration ci in short
jenkins failure notification
IDE 
are used for coding
examples
eclipse
visual studio
atom
pycharm
version control
git 
svn
tfs
perforce
etc
build tools
maven ant gradle
msbuild visual build
ibm urban code 
make 
grunt
software repository
ci tools
jenkins
circleci
teamcity
bamboo ci
6 - What is continuous delivery
automatic process to give changes to servers
enormous face

CI watch it before continuing
    - the process
    CI is automation of code and test
    automatically build and tested
    if everything is good, the artifact is stored in software repositories
    the goal of ci is to detect defects in early stage
    Scene
    - ops teams get regular request from the ci process from further testing
    ops teams deploy artifacts to the server
    higher lead time
    devops teams such deployment failures
    agile sdlc
    regular code changes that need deploy
